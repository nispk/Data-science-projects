# Data-science-projects

1). Finace Project:
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016. we will learn how to use pandas to directly read data from Yahoo finance using pandas!.We need to get data using pandas datareader. We will get stock information for the following banks:
*  Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

We have created dataframe objects for the stock data from Jan 1st 2006 to Jan 1st 2016 for each of these banks. Set each bank to be a separate dataframe, with the variable name for that bank being its ticker symbol. This will involve a few steps:**
1. Use datetime to set start and end datetime objects.
2. Figure out the ticker symbol for each bank.
2. Figure out how to use datareader to grab info on the stock.

Later we perform data visualization using different libraries such as- matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, cufflinks or just pandas.
